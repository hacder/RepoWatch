* Make diff show new files as well as modified ones.
* Ultra ultra basics of project time tracking.


Future Features
---------------

1. Handle Branching
2. Handle Stashes and Unstashes
3. Plugin To Do Whatever
4. Project time tracking, based on new edits. Very rough, but better than
   nothing.

Before Next Beta
----------------
1. Think that the upstream diff screen only shows the first line of either
   text box. Fix that.
2. Make upstream updates happen more than just at start.

Working on Now
--------------
1. Nag screen
2. Startup Configuration Screen
3. Handle huge repository numbers gracefully (start using a time delay in the scanner as we find more
   and more repositories. this should make the initial HIGH cpu spike ease off)
4. License manager.

Time Tracker
------------

1. Manual Start of timer
2. Manual Stop of timer
3. Automatic start/stop based on diff lines changing
