Done:
	* Make diff show new files as well as modified ones.
	* Ultra ultra basics of project time tracking.
	* Colorize diffs
	* Build file list when looking at local diffs
	* Fix onofftimes. Seems to lose info after a restart.
* Does not seem to notice updates after the initial start. At least on git.
* Make file list show up in table when looking at local diffs
* Make files in Diff class actually be represented by FileDiff.
* Continue settling on more sane per-repository set of code.
* Severe performance issues when commit window is up. Not sure why, but it started
  when I added the colorization.

Future Features
---------------

1. Handle Branching
2. Handle Stashes and Unstashes
3. Plugin To Do Whatever
4. Startup Configuration Screen
5. Handle huge repository numbers gracefully (start using a time delay in the scanner as we find more
   and more repositories. this should make the initial HIGH cpu spike ease off)
6. Handle no git and no mercurial gracefully.
7. Look into github or the mercurial equivalent for some sort of project suggestion feature.

Preferences:
